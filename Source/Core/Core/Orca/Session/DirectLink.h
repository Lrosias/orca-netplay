// Direct links between the Orcas in a room: one UDP path per pair of players alongside the room's
// relay, so inputs go straight to the other machine instead of through Cloudflare and the room's
// Durable Object.
//
// Like Slippi, the data path is plain UDP with inputs repeated until acknowledged. Orca connects
// with ICE (libjuice): host candidates on every interface, the public address from STUN, and
// Cloudflare TURN from the room ticket as a last resort. Signalling rides the room as peer
// messages. Every datagram is sealed with ChaCha20-Poly1305 under keys both players contribute to.
// The relay keeps carrying every packet too and the first copy to arrive wins (the session handles
// duplicates), so a link that fails or never opens costs nothing beyond the relay's latency. See
// ORCA.md, "Direct links".
