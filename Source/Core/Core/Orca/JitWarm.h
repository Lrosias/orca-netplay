// JIT warm-up. The first frames of a match make Dolphin's JIT compile tens of thousands of blocks,
// which shows up as long frames as the stage and fighters appear. Orca records which blocks a match
// compiled (address, instruction ranges, and a hash of their words) and, in later matches, compiles
// those whose words are back in RAM a few ms per frame while the match loads. See ORCA.md,
// "Match start".
//
// Host-side only, and it must produce exactly the block the JIT would have compiled: same words
// and addresses, same feature flags, guest float mode and the same instruction ranges, or it is
// thrown away. Like JIT blocks kept across rollback, this relies on the game invalidating code it
// rewrites, so blocks whose words changed soon after compiling are never recorded. Only
// instruction-BAT-mapped code is touched, and nothing compiles when it could clear code memory
// under the running block (JitBase::CanCompileFromHook).
