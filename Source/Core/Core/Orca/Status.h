//     friend-waiting ("left lobby": the host left its friends for a With Anyone queue pick)
//   orca error <code> <sentence for the player>
//   orca menu <event>       a pick in the game's own Online menu
//   orca result <json>      a matchmade room's verdict (with the app's "results")

//   orca active <interval_s> <active_s> <inputs> <mode> <pads>   how much the player played, every
//     60 s and when the game stops; embedded, never before "ready" (Orca/Activity.h)
// Error codes: boot, cancelled, disc_missing, disc_unreadable, disc_revision, profile, settings,
// room_mismatch, room_full, kicked, network, peer_left, desync, signed_out (the keyframe store
// refused a signed-out player's game; the host says "friend-left signed_out"), internal. Only the
// first error is printed, since it explains the exit. Outside a session nothing is printed.

//   pause    Orca pauses a session while the player's game is alone in it
