// Picks are read only on first runs, never on rollback re-runs, and announced only while this game
// plays alone. A Casual or Ranked pick made while it isn't alone (friends in it or about to land)
// goes to the session instead (TakeLobbyPick): a host whose app can search that queue leaves its
// friends and announces it, one that can't keeps them and announces it unarmed ("kept"), and a
// joiner lets it go; once its host has left, it comes home on the character select that pick
// opened and announces the pick that select holds (CssPick). Acting on a pick while inputs may
// still be guessed is safe: the session ends at that boundary. After a resync (Events NoteResync)
