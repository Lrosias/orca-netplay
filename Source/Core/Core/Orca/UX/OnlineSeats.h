// No CPUs online: an online character select shows only the players who are there, and no CPU
// reaches an online fight. See ORCA.md, "No CPUs online".
//
// The Versus character select builds its panels from a record the game keeps between visits
// (gmSelCharData) and saves them back as it goes on to the stage select. Brawl resets the record
// when Versus starts from the main menu; Project+ doesn't, so a CPU from a local game could come
// back on an online select and play in the match.
//
// A select is online (Online()) when the header locks, when the main menu's pick is With Friends,
// Casual or Ranked, or when two ports or more are plugged in. Offline modes keep their CPUs.
//
// While online, every frame boundary (first runs and re-runs) writes only the bytes that differ, so
// this stays a pure, idempotent function of emulated memory and the synced ports:
// - ClearRecord, between two scenes only: a CPU's state, and a human's on a port nobody plugged
//   in, become nobody's. This lands before the character select builds its panels (5 boundaries
//   before in Project+, 33 in Brawl), and never on the stage select or in a fight, so no fight
//   loses a player.
// - ClearPanels, on the character select: a CPU's panel becomes empty, so the select saves no CPU.
//   It keeps its CPU plate until ApplySeats hides it or a player joins it. A human's panel on an
//   unplugged port is left to the game, which empties it 17 frames after the controller goes;
//   emptying it first would leave the token's highlight on the grid.
// - GateMasks, without a header: A never reaches a player-type button, another panel's name
//   button, or any place within one frame's travel of them. The player's own name button and its
//   list take A as on the queue's own select (Rules::CssNameTakesA). A panel a CPU had is joined by
//   Orca pressing A for its port while that port's hand rests on the panel's player-type button
//   (PressesJoin).
// - ApplySeats, on the character select: an empty panel whose port nobody plugged in is hidden.
//   Hiding only stops drawing; the panel's logic and buttons stay. A panel that should show gets
//   Orca's hide bits cleared on any character select.
