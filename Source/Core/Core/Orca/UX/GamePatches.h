// Orca's own game patches from Data/Sys/Orca/<profile>.patches. They are always on in a session
// (the player's own GameSettings codes are dropped) and are hashed into the lobby compatibility
// key. A launcher profile's file (e.g. PPLUS32.patches) may only hold guarded groups, since the
// launcher's own codes own most memory. One 32-bit word per line, all hex:
//
//   <address> <original> <value>   # guarded: written only if memory holds <original>
//   <address> * <value>             # data: written every frame
//
// Consecutive guarded lines (4 bytes apart) form a group, written only while every word still
// holds its original. So a code patch lands once each time its module loads, and never into some
// other module that later occupies the same memory (one word could match by chance; a run of words
// won't). A data group can include a marker word ('ORCA') so it lands only once and later player
// choices stick. A line whose original equals its value is a pure guard.
//
// Toggled groups switch on and off with a condition on memory instead of landing once:
//
//   when <address> == <value>
//   when <address> & <mask> != <value>
//   <address> <original> <value>   # guarded lines, grouped as above
//   end
//
// While all `when` lines hold, a group holding its originals gets its values; otherwise a group
// holding its values gets its originals back. Anything else is left alone. Rules: blocks don't
// nest, contain no `*` lines, and each group has at least two words with at least one changing (it
// matches in both states, so it needs more words to avoid false matches). A condition may not read
// a word the file writes. Meant for branch flips while an online mode is on; real code goes in a
// cave.
//
// Patches apply at every frame boundary, including resimulated frames, and depend only on emulated
// memory, so both machines and every rollback make the same writes. Code words go through
// Dolphin's memory-patch path so the JIT drops stale copies. Toggled groups apply last, after
// every other frame-hook writer.
