// Puts each player's YouGame username into Brawl's own name tags, so the game shows it over the
// fighter and on the results. Each tag also carries that player's own controls, so they keep their
// layout in someone else's game.
//
// Memory layout (Brawl rev 2; Project+ runs the same executable):
//   - Save tags: g_GameGlobal (0x805A00E0) +0x28 -> records (0x90172D40), tag i at
//     +0xE0 + i * 0x124. Name first, up to 5 UTF-16BE characters and a 0. Empty name = unused.
//   - Tag controls: +0x0C rumble (1 on), +0x14 layout, 0x2D bytes, defaults at 0x80406938.
//     GameCube 12 bytes (L, R, Z, D-pad up, side, down, A, B, C-stick, Y, X, then flags: tap jump
//     0x80, set up 0x70; the page's Save also sets 0x01, not tap jump, which profiles neither
//     carry nor clear), Wii Remote 8, with Nunchuk 12 (last: shake smash 0x80, tap jump 0x40,
//     not set up 0x03), Classic 13 (last: tap jump 0x80). Other bytes are actions (0 attack,
//     1 special, 2 jump, 3 shield, 4 grab, 5 smash, 9 taunt, 0xA-0xC taunts, 0xE none).
//   - On scMelee's first frame the game copies each port's tag layout into the per-port table
//     (0x805B7480, pointed to by 0x805A00C8), which the match reads. So whatever a port's tag holds
//     when the match starts is what that port plays with.
//   - Character select: scene manager (0x805A0060) +4 -> scene ("scSelctCharacter"), +0x400 ->
//     muSelCharTask, +0x44 + 4 * i -> player area i: +0x1B0 port i, +0x1B4 kind (1: human joined),
//     +0x1C8 tag (-1: none). Joining clears the tag to -1. Leaving the screen copies each tag into
//     gmPlayerInitData (+0x0C name, +0x18 tag index).
//
// On every character-select frame, a joined port with a named player and no tag gets one: the tag
// already holding that name, else the highest unused one, built as the game builds one. A duplicate
// name gets its port number as the last character (SAND2). The player's controls are written into
// it. A port with controls but no showable name gets "P<port>". A port with neither gets nothing.
// The game's own name list types tags in full-width characters (U+FF21 for A) while Orca writes
// ASCII, so names match as they read (width and case folded), and a tag the player typed in the
// game wins over one Orca made of that name: a player who made their tag in Options > Controls
// plays with it and gets no second tag of that name (before, Orca made one at the game's defaults,
// put them in it, and never read their own).
// A joined port with controls that wears a tag holding exactly what the game puts in a tag it makes
// (rumble on, the default layout: a tag the player just made, or made again after a restart, since
// tags made in the game last only until Orca closes) gets its controls written into that tag too.
//
// Determinism: writes depend only on emulated memory and the session's synced port list, and are
// idempotent (a re-run frame writes the same bytes; a port that wears a tag is left alone once that
// tag no longer holds the game's defaults). Names and controls come from the host (OnlineMatch.cpp,
// "Ports") and every machine has them before the frame they apply from.
//
// TODO: the character select's name plate keeps "PLAYER n" until the game redraws it (its setter,
// 0x8069B1CC, only runs when the player picks a tag). Needs a game-side code.
