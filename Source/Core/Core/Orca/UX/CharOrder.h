// Character pick order for games 2+ of a ranked set, on the game's own character select. See
// ORCA.md, "Character order". Two orders exist (kLaterGameOrder picks one):
//   - WinnerFirst (in use, as in the standard rulesets): the winner picks, then the loser picks
//     knowing the winner's character.
//   - Free: the loser is asked first; the winner may lock in at any time meanwhile.
// Each turn has 45 seconds. When time runs out, the player keeps the character their token is on
// (by default the previous game's).
//
// Controls on your turn: A places the token on a character, B picks it back up, Start locks the
// pick in. Start never reaches the game here; the order reads it from the raw input latch
// (Queue.h RAW). The other player's controller does nothing until their turn. Once both have
// picked, a queue2 room continues straight on (Queue.h); otherwise Orca presses Start for the
// second picker. A player who timed out with the token in hand can only move and place it.
//
// Locking in needs Start, not A: tokens stay placed from one game's character select to the next,
// and A on another character would otherwise lock in the old pick.
//
// Everything is a pure function of emulated memory and the frame number, so both machines and
// every resimulation agree. State lives in the match block at kArea, written only by the frame
// hook, and the input gate's masks are computed from that memory (Rollback/InputGate.h).
//
// Brawl uses the same order as Project+. Supernova's exact order puts the stage pick before the
// characters; MkFreePicker() is that order's Meta Knight rule, for when it is implemented.
//
// Character select memory (Brawl rev 2 and Project+): scene "scSelctCharacter" +0x400 is
// muSelCharTask; port i's area is at task +0x44 + 4 * i:
//   +0x0C u32 held buttons, +0x10 newly pressed (PAD_* bits, after the input gate)
//   +0x1B4 player kind (1 = a human has joined)
//   +0x1B8 character under the hand while holding the token, else the token's (kNoCharacter: none)
//   +0x1F8 u8 1 while the token is in hand, +0x1F9 1 while it is flying
