// The matchmaking queue's character select, Slippi-style. See ORCA.md, "The queue's character
// select".
//
// While searching, the player waits on the local Versus character select where only their own
// panel works. Picking and pressing Start makes them ready (`orca queue ready <casual|ranked>
// <char> <costume>`), and B un-readies (`orca queue unready`). Once matched, the joiner's pick is
// steered onto port 2, and a ready timer runs before the stage select. Casual players can hold Z to
// skip (`orca queue skip`). Ranked has no skip.
//
// Every in-game decision is a pure function of emulated memory, the frame number and the session's
// synced values, written to the MatchBlock::QUEUE region only where it differs, so rollback re-runs
// compute the same result. Masked presses reach the logic through the input gate's latch. Stdout
// lines and the overlay are local and come from first runs only.
