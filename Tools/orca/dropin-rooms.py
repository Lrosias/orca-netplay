# dropin-rooms.py: rooms that go wrong, over real YouGame rooms, steered with the app's stdin
# commands (ORCA.md "Embedding") as in dropin-commands.py, headless and muted.
#
#   Tools/orca/dropin-rooms.py <dolphin-emu-nogui> <disc>
#
# 1. A friend joins a room nobody's game is in: it gives up within seconds (peer_left), plays on.
# 2. The friend reaches a room before its host's game does: the host finds someone else hosting
#    it, says so (orca error network) and opens a fresh room; the friend gives up (peer_left).
# 3. The friend leaves while it catches up (the host's keyframe is 25 s old, from a prepare-join, so
#    the friend replays 25 s of its game): it leaves at once ("left"), and the host hears a plain
#    leave, not a stall. Then it joins the host's fresh room: "friend-joined" once it plugs in.
# 4. The host's connection drops mid-match (the test-only "test-drop-room"): the host says so,
#    reconnects to the same room (its player id comes back into its held seat), and the friend,
#    whose host left, plays on ("host-left", then "no-room": it is on port 2) and joins it again.
#    Then the app's Stop on the host, "leave" and "quit" at once: the friend hears it within ~1 s.
# 5. Both behind a fake app bridge (Tools/orca/fake_bridge.py), the friend joining from an invite:
#    the host's page sends Leave. The host's page is told the room is empty, then shown the host's
#    new room. The friend's page is told the old room is empty and never shows it again: in a fight
#    the friend then says "no-room" (port 2); on the menus it goes home (port 1, a room of its own,
#    which its page is shown).
# Where a step leaves the friend on a port other than 1 (3, 4 and 5), it either goes home at once
# (it was on the menus) or says "no-room" (in a fight): both pass.
# 6. A friend whose host stops goes home and can queue: both behind the bridge with the queue's
#    character select (caps host queue2) and live pads, no input script. The friend joins the host
#    on the main menu, both go to With Friends' character select, and the host's app stops. The
#    friend hears "host-left", backs out (held B), picks With Anyone > Ranked from the ONLINE page,
#    a character, and Start: "orca queue ready ranked" within 10 s. It came home on the character
#    select (port 1), never said "no-room", and its page was shown a room of its own.
# 7. With Anyone with a friend in the game: the same pair on With Friends' character select; the
#    host backs out and picks With Anyone > Ranked with the friend still plugged in: "orca state
#    left lobby", then "orca menu online ranked". The friend hears "host-left" and goes home on the
#    character select the pick opened, where it takes the pick too. Neither backs out: each picks a
#    character and presses Start where it landed, and both say "orca queue ready ranked".
# 8. The same, but the friend presses With Anyone > Ranked in the shared menu: the host leaves for
#    the queue all the same, and the friend comes home on its Ranked select, armed.
# 9. A friend drops into the room of a guest that came home: the pair on With Friends' character
#    select, the host's app stops, and the friend goes home (port 1, a room of its own). A new Orca
#    joins that room from an invite, both play 15 s, the new one's app leaves, and the session ends
#    with matched checksums ("friend-joined", then "friend-left", no error).
# 10. The same pair, but the host's page can't search Ranked now (no pick-ranked in its caps): the
#    host's Ranked pick keeps the friend. The host prints `orca menu online ranked kept` and no
#    `left lobby`, the friend hears nothing, and the page's `queue-cancel` changes nothing; after
#    8 s both still play together. Then the friend's app leaves: the session ends with matched
#    checksums, the host arms the kept pick (`orca menu online ranked`, then `orca queue ready
#    ranked` after Start), and the friend goes home there and takes the pick too.
#   --only rooms|page|home|lobby|guest|rejoin|stay[,...]: those steps alone (rooms: 1-4, page: 5,
#   home: 6, lobby: 7, guest: 8, rejoin: 9, stay: 10).
# Each step waits for the lines it expects and fails on a timeout. Runs two Orca processes at most.
